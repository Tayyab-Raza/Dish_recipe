                    Don't have pizza bases at home but want to make pizza? Can't
                    order from home because it is too late? Don't worry we have
                    a solution for you. This Roti Pizza will help you to try a
                    new pizza recipe where you will not need pizza bases. You
                    can use any type of pre-cooked roti or even rotis left from
                    the previous day to make these delicious pizzas. This is a
                    quick recipe for when you have guests over and can't think
                    of making some delicious appetiser. You will just need pasta
                    sauce, cheese, some vegetables and roti to make these
                    pizzas. You can also make this pizza for your little ones
                    and they won't even know that you have used roti as a base
                    instead of actual pizza bases. If you want to avoid the
                    heavy maida base of pizza that is available in the market,
                    then you can easily give the pizza a healthier twist by
                    using a whole wheat base in the form of roti. We have added
                    some regular veggies here, however, you can customize the
                    pizza by adding veggies of your choice. Do try this recipe,
                    rate it and let us know how it turned out to be.
